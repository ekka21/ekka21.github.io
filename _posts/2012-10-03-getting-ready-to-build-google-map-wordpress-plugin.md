I &#8216;m very excited to start building the Google Map WordPress Plugin! Just submit a request to host my file at WordPress.org. The main focus for me on this plugin is &#8220;**Simplicity**&#8220;. A User only have to import an excelÂ spreadsheet. Then, they will automatically appear in custom post types. The only one thing is left to do is to add short code right into a page, post or widget as you wish.

This is going to be a very good learning experience and I want to give back to WordPress Community!

Cheers!
