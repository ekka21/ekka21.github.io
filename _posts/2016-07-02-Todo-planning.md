It's time to build a prototype. Here are my thought that comes into my
mind right now.
- I'm building a todo app.
- Ok, I need a user story.
- An user goes to this website and can:
  - create a todo item
  - delete a todo item
  - mark a todo item as completed
  - view todo items
  - share a todo link with a unique url that gets created automatically
- Let's bootstrap up all of these functionality up with
[Laravel](http://laravel.com)
- Try to minimize the frontend work as much as possible.

That should be good enought. Let's do this.
