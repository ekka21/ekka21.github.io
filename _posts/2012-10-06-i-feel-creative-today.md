I&#8217;ve been inspired to learn something new and pick up a new hobby, and for some reason that feeling is really strong today. I need an outlet!

Photography has always been in the back of my mind for the whole time. So today is the day I&#8217;m getting into it. I know nothing about photography but I strongly believe that I can become a really good photographer.

So stick around, I&#8217;ll post some of my experience from knowing nothing to somewhat knowing how to shoot a decent photo.
