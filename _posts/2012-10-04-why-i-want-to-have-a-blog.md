Well&#8230;for a several reasons, firstly I have been saying that I want to have my own blog for years. I don&#8217;t want to be that guy who just keeps saying it without doing it. I &#8216;m a man of my words!

Secondly, I want to have a place where I can keep track of all my tips, tricks tutorials, code snippets and all things I &#8216;ve developed over the years.

I know at one point if you are a developer, you have said &#8220;How did I do this? I think I have implemented the code somewhere somehow. Where the hell is it&#8230;.damn it!&#8221;

Lastly, I want to give back to the open source community. The open source has changed not only my career but it also changed my life. I couldn&#8217;t imagine software without open source!
