As a web developer, I have a lot of app ideas but I've never followed
through. I admit it, I'm a procasinator. I even
[blog](http://ekkachai.net/2015/10/23/stop-procrastinating/) about it a
while back and hoping that will change me somehow. But guess what I made ZERO
progress. I am at the same spot last year and may be the year before!

# The problem
I tent to over complicate things that I came up with. I wanted to build
a PERFECT product. The product that will be the next big thing and so I
can quit my job and have my own startup company.

By the time I was building the app, I was mentally exhausted. Next thing I know, I felt
defeated and gave up on the idea. This cycle keeps repeat itself over and over and over...it has gotton to stop!!

That is my problem. I'm sure you can relate especically if you're a
developer. I know you are. Yes, I'm looking at you.

# The solution
I need pratices. I mean a lot of pratices. So I'm going to build a really simple web application. The purpose of
building this app is more about the process of getting it done and launching it within one week. I'll blog about the technical, non-technical of what I learn from start to finish.

Hopefully, my journey will inspire you one way or another.

> It's about a journey not a destination.

# The product
With a minimal viable product in mind, I'm going to build a "To Do Application". Nothing fancy, just a to do list where an user can:

- Create a todo item
- Edit a todo item
- Delete a todo item
- View all todo items
- Mark a complete todo item

That is. Let's do it.
