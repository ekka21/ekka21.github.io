As a web developer, I have a lot of app ideas but I've never followed
through. I admit it, I'm a procasinator. I even
[blog](http://ekkachai.net/2015/10/23/stop-procrastinating/) about it a
while back and hoping that will change me somehow. But guess what I made ZERO
progress. I am at the same spot last year and may be the year before!

# The problem
I tent to over complicate things that I came up with. I wanted to build
a PERFECT product. The product that will be the next big thing and so I
can quit my job and have my own startup company.

By the time I was building the app, I was mentally exhausted. Next thing I know, I felt
defeated and gave up on the idea. This cycle keeps repeat itself over and over and over...it has gotton to stop!!

That is my problem. I'm sure you can relate especically if you're a
developer. I know you are. Yes, I'm looking at you.

# The solution
I need pratices. I mean a lot of pratices. Here is what I'm going to do.
I'm going to build the most simple web application. The purpose of
building this app is that it's not about the product itself but it's
about the process of creating and launching the app. Along the way, I'll
be bloging about the technical, non-technical of what I learn from start
to finish.

Hopefully, my journey will inspire you one way or another.

> It's about a journey not a destination.

# The product
I need a minimal viable product, a really simple one.

I'm going to build a "To Do Application". Nothing fancy, just a to do list where an user can:

- Create a todo item
- Edit a todo item
- Delete a todo item
- View all todo items
- Mark a complete todo item

That is. Let's do it.

# What I have lean?
To be continue...
