I am the first one to admit it that I&#8217;m a procrastinator. I&#8217;m surprise that I even get anything done at all. I have a lot of side projects and ideas to do but none of them is getting no where. Why? Why?

So note to self, **STOP PROCRASTINATING! **

Just to remind my future self, you need to do these things below:

  1. **Just Hustling** &#8211; Test your market first, don&#8217;t create an app or a fancy website. Just start small and get feedback
  2. **Deadlines **&#8211; Give it a hard deadline. It&#8217;s do or die time!
  3. **Give a shit **&#8211; Whatever you do &#8211; give a 100% shit. Do what you **want to**, not what you **have to**
