I have been using <a href="http://ekkachai.net/2015/10/23/vim-workflow/" target="_blank">Vim</a> on and off for the past 1-2 years but lately I uninstall on GUI editor on my machine to force myself learn more about Vim. It was very rough for the first week or two. But I feel like Vim is my new home now. To be honest, Vim is useless out of the box. I have to install plugins, additional tool to make it better. Combining Vim with <a href="http://ekkachai.net/2015/10/29/tmux-workflow/" target="_blank">Tmux</a> and <a href="http://ekkachai.net/2015/11/04/tmuxinator-to-rescue/" target="_blank">Tmuxinator</a>
