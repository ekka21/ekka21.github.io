The list of things(technologies) I want to use/master in 2013.

  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">PaaS (Pagoda)</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">PHP 5.4</span>
  * Laravel 4
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">RequiredJS</span>
  * Compass/SASS

To get it done, I &#8216;m going to need to come up with a fake project that will use all these technologies. I &#8216;m thinking about building a simple blog/cms. It&#8217;s gonna to be fun and I &#8216;ll blog about this project along the way.

Stay Tune!
